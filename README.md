# Adding_New_Texts_To_OpenITI

Repository to streamline the process of adding new texts to OpenITI

The overall workflow is as follows:

1. Folder `new_texts` can be used to add texts that should be included into OpenITI.
  - users can `fork` this repository and add a text that would like to include into OpenITI into the `new_texts` folder.
  - they then send a pull request, where they suggest a URI for their new text.
    - the users should first check whether relevant URIs already exist (either for the author or the book).
    - if the URI does not exist, the users should use the logic described here: <https://maximromanov.github.io/OpenITI/#a-note-on-the-principles-of-assigning-human-readable-uris>
